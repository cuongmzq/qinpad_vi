# qinpad_vi

Added supported for Vietnamese
I'm not originally develop the whole project, just modify it from suborg qinpad source code, with the help of googling.
Please examinate the source code for list of functionalities
Currently, I'll will not developing this project anymore...May be I will develop another version, more efficiency and more functionality with java or c++ source code instead of kotlin.
The source code may be not the most recent version, since my hard drive is broken.
